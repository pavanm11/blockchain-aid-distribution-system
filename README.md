# blockchain-aid-distribution-system
A decentralized aid distribution platform integrated with AI for predictive fund allocation. Built using Blockchain (Solidity), Flask backend, and a machine learning model to optimize and verify aid distribution.


# Blockchain-Based AI Aid Distribution System

This project is a decentralized aid distribution platform enhanced with AI. It ensures transparent fund distribution using blockchain and intelligently allocates resources using predictive modeling.

## Features
- Smart contract-based aid tracking (Solidity)
- Flask backend with Random Forest model for prediction
- Static frontend for user interaction

## Tech Stack
- Blockchain: Solidity, Hardhat
- AI: Python, scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Backend: Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Storage: IPFS

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Deploy contracts using Hardhat
3. Start the Flask backend
4. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser
